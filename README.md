# jSoft Bot
## Blockchain Trading Bot

This is the code for the tutorial : "Learn dApp coding by writing a Blockchain Trading Bot"

The folders contain the code of each of my blog post of this series on http://www.jsot.biz

The language used is Javascript but it is implemented simply enough so you can understand the concepts even if you're not a Javascript expert.

## Running the tutorials

Don't forget to edit the test-settings.json file and put your secret key (NEVER SHARE IT) and moralis private URL

When inside a folder, do once a dependencies install 

```shell
npm install
```

then you can run the bot:

```shell
node jsoftbot.js
```
